TODOS:
- remove large header background images
- change fonts on page to make sure that they're system fonts
- maybe if mouse is inactive on page for a while, you can black out the page with a small informative message
- change color scheme to be more energy efficient
	- white does not necessarily use more energy than black in all cases
- halt any gifs that are playing
	- this could be something where you have to hover over the gif to have it play
- suspend animations
- remove ads on the banners
- notification to update chrome
- suspend google chrome tabs
- reminder to remove extensions
- maybe include tab saver?
- option to not let chrome run in background
- enable click-to-play plugins
- introduce a limit to the number of tabs you can have
- tips for reducing energy usage i.e. things the extension doesnt have the ability to do
	- remove excess extensions
- disable hardware acceleration
